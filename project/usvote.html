          <h2>People's vote</h2>
          <p>Data Visualization for 2008-2020 US Election</p>
          <p class="text">
            The visualization and data analysis of election data can help
            political parties formulate election strategies and help relevant
            agencies predict election results. Most existing election data
            visualizations use choropleth maps to illustrate the distribution of
            votes between Republican Party and Democratic Party in the same
            election. However, this is far from enough for analyzing election
            patterns since it only makes comparison in the regional level. Our
            goal is to develop a more comprehensive way to visualize the effect
            of time on election patterns through dynamic interaction.

          <h3>Data Visulazation</h3>

          <p class="text">
            There are few use cases we have performed on our visualization tool,
            to achieve our tasks. First we select the choropleth map, then
            select state view. We can look at the colored choropleth map of
            United States, with color scaled from blue to red. By clicking the
            play button, the map is displaying year by year in animation. we can
            easily find some pattern in the visualization, we can also pause the
            playing and see any year we want.

          <p class="text">
            We can also perform several similar use cases by switching to the
            bubble map or switch to the county view. Furthermore, no matter
            which map we are looking at, we can always click on the map, the
            detail of the point where we clicked well appear in the right of the
            screen. We can compare the election results in the history of that
            specific state/county.

            Besides, the bar chartâ€™s segmented coloring is a appropriate way to
            show the distribution of votes of the two parties, so we also
            adopted the visualization form of the bar chart.
