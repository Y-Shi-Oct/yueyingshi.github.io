          <p>
            A data-enabled design study on friends and family members’
            co-responsibility in diabetes type 2 management.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Overall, the number of people with diabetes worldwide has more than
            doubled over the past three decades.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            By means of a data-enabled design approach, this study explored how
            friends, family, and other people that might support diabetes
            patients can be assisted in their co-responsible role.
          </p>

          </div>

          <h3>Prototype</h3>
          <p class="text">
            My made two self-report devices, i.e. the prototype, to collect the
            data. The study materials consisted of a measuring device and a Data
            Foundry chatbot. The measuring device, as shown below, allowed the
            participant to track answers to the following four questions:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>How much in control do you feel?</li>
            <li>How much attention are you paying to your health?</li>
            <li>How do you feel today?</li>
            <li>ow physically active were you today?</li>
          </ol>
          <p class="text">
            By means of the chatbot, photos of the food and drink intake were
            captured. The participant was asked to write a short description
            alongside the photo for analysis purposes later.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
          <p class="text">
            The data from the self-report prototype was sent over for 6 days and
            then analyzed.
          </p>

          <h3>Design Intervention</h3>
          <p class="text">
            The design intervention resulting from this project is ‘The Knot’,
            as can be seen in figures below. The results show that after many
            years of marriage and experiences with diabetes treatment, a very
            stable support system between the patient and co-responsible person
            has been set. Measuring support to track the feelings of given and
            received support is not needed anymore as the support is already
            tailored to the existing situation and relationship. However,
            communicating blood sugar levels is still relevant at this stage. In
            the beginning stages of a (platonic) relationship or when someone
            has just been diagnosed, co-responsibility coaching might still be
            of added value.
