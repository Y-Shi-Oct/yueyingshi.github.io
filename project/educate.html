            To halt the spreading of the coronavirus, social distancing is
            implemented in many countries. Not only students but also staffs
            working in higher education had to make a quick switch to online
            education. This all while studies have warned that online education
            can harm student performance, especially students who are already
            struggling.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will go through different steps of the design cycle in order to
            improve the online studying experience of college students in higher
            education.

            As a prerequisite for all analysis work, we do some preparation work
            with our data gathered from the empathizing part, that is, notes of
            8 semi-structured interviews. The notes were filled into the
            question list thus the individual interview records for every
            interviewee is generated. All of our members familiarize ourselves
            with the data by browsing the records.

            And the affinity diagram making procedure was carried out with MIRO.
            Then we use codes to summarize many categories for our sticky notes.
            Around 20 codes were developed at first, and 23 codes in the end
            after several times combining and re-organization with theme
            adjustments.

            Then we conducted a usability test with 5 users who also took part
            in the previous interview. The inVision prototype which used in the
            test is attached below.
