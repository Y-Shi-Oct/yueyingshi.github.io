          <h2>E-ducate</h2>
          <p>
            E-ducate aims to helping university teachers and students to quickly
            and efficiently switch their working and learning styles to adapt to
            the new norm of distance learning.
          </p>
          <h3>Background</h3>

          <p class="text">
            To halt the spreading of the coronavirus, social distancing is
            implemented in many countries. Not only students but also staffs
            working in higher education had to make a quick switch to online
            education. This all while studies have warned that online education
            can harm student performance, especially students who are already
            struggling.
          </p>

          <h3>Analysis</h3>

          <p class="text">
            We will go through different standard steps of the design cycle in
            order to improve the online studying experience of college students
            in higher education.
          </p>

          <p class="text">
            We conducted the semi-structure interview with eight potential users
            and analysis the data with affinity diagram. As showing in the
            graph, the feedback from interview were noted down on digital sticky
            notes. Then the sticky notes were coded and grouped to generate some
            insights. The interest points and pain points were clusterd into the
            themes including motivation lacking and interaction missing.

          <h3>User test and Prototype </h3>
          <p class="text">
            Then we conducted a usability test with five users who also took
            part in the previous pre-design interview for iteration insights.
            The inVision prototype which used in the test is attached below.
