                    <p>This project is derived from the requirement of the topic "Data Enabled Design". We needed to
                        advance the design through objective data collection and analysis.</p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike previous patient-only designs, we decided to start with the patient's co-habitants this
                        time. We observed and analyzed data from a week in the lives of diabetic patients and their
                        partners, and designed an interactive lighting device to facilitate communication and raise
                        awareness about healthy eating.

                    <p> Data collection was divided into two phases, an objective data collection phase and a subjective
                        data collection phase. The objective data was collected using both the control panel unit and
                        the PCR infrared sensor on the bathroom door. Data were collected in the following manner.

                            The collection of self reporting information from patients and family members is done
                            through the Telegram platform chatbot (top left). Users are required to report every food
                            and drink they intake. Through an automated script, the bot reminds the patient three times
                            a day to reports. The bot receives data from the user and puts it into a database, from
                            which we can estimate the amount of sugar consumed by the user and their lifestyle patterns.
                            We also sent daily questionnaires via a Telegram chatbot asking about the support that the
                            cohabitants felt they "gave" and the support that the patients felt they "received". Users
                            can use the components on the tangeble panel for input.</p>

                            <p> We analyzed the data collected. As shown in the figure, the couples agreed fairly
                                consistently on the "giving" and "receiving" of their daily support, and consistently
                                gave
                                high scores. Therefore, we hypothesize that couples have effective communication.

                            <p>The patient's wife was inspired by our data and believed that the trough in the graph of

                                "daily support level" was due to the fact that both partners were busy on that day and
                                communication was reduced. Therefore, we believe that the presentation of information is
                                actually more motivating for the patient and the patient than specific "communication
                                coaching".</p>

                    <p>Based on our data analysis and user interviews, we designed the interactive lighting device shown
                        in the figure. The main material is a frosted glass lamp in cream color, divided into two ends.
                        The form of the anthropomorphic knot has the symbolic meaning of "communication connection".
                        There is a variable height lamp bead in each of the left and right lamps, and the height of the
                        lamp bead is changed by collecting data from the user's cell phone. The left bead represents the
                        patient's blood glucose level; the right bead represents the patient's insulin intake.</p>
                    <p>
                        The height of the two beads can guide the patient's insulin intake (as shown above) on the
                        one hand, and let the family members living with the patient know the current health and
                        medication status on the other.
                        The patient's motivation to communicate about his physical condition has increased
                        significantly. "He will now voluntarily share the data in the blood glucose recording app
                        with me." The patient's family mentioned this.</p>
