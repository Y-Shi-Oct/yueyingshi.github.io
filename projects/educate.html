                <p>During the covid-19 epidemic, the way people live, learn and socialize has changed a lot. In
                    this project our team, through interviews, concluded that the most urgent and valuable pain
                    point to change is the decrease in motivation and efficiency of learning caused by students not
                    adapting to online class habits. Based on this pain point, we designed the E-ducate online
                    learning platform, which combines multiple forms of feedback to stimulate students' interest in
                    learning and classroom integration.

            <h5 class="my-3">User research and data analysis</h5>
            <p>To better understand the needs of users, we conducted eight semi-structure interviews. We found
                suitable users from the our social network who fit in the target group -- college
                students.The interviews were conducted on site, with the interviewer, recorder, and interviewee.
            </p>
            <p>These questions focus on a broad scope to learn more about the whole life changes caused by covid-19. For
                example, where and how they lived during the lockdown. What activities they did before, during, and
                after covid situation. </p>
            <p>we digged into the details that they mentioned, to find the underlying reason and need.</p>
            <div class="pic-side my-3">
                <img src="../img/educate/interview.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="row d-flex flex-row-reverse">
                <div class="col-md-6 my-3">

                    <p>We fragmented and coded all the interview information to create an Affinity Diagram. We
                        clustered their comments into themes and extracted user pain points from them. </p>

                    <p>After that, we defined and categorized the pain points according to "urgency" and "optimized
                        value", and
                        proceeded to design for the urgent and valuable pain points.</p>

                    <p>In the process of analyzing the interview data, we found that most of the users mentioned
                        that COVID-19 had affected their learning. The sudden shift in learning style to online has
                        severely weakened the face-to-face interaction experience in the traditional classroom. At
                        the same time, the lack of "peer pressure" also makes students less effective.</p>

                <div class="col-md-6 my-3">
                    <p>In the previous interviews, we extracted the core pain point: students have difficulty
                        maintaining high learning efficiency during the transition to online education.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, we used a opposite-thinking approach to brainstorming. Each team member wrote
                        down several hypotheses about the issue at hand, trying to cover all aspects of the issue at
                        hand, such as "students find it harder to concentrate in online classes than in live
                        classes".</p>
                    <p>Then for all of these hypotheses, the group members wrote down the "opposite" of the
                        hypothesis, such as "students think it is easier to concentrate in online classes". After
                        each opposing opinion was written down, the panelists worked together to think about these
                        new realities, how it affected this core pain point, and the resulting potential solutions.

                    <p>1. Test introduction: We will introduce the purpose and scenario of using the current
                        software. We also informed the test users that they needed to think out loud.</p>
                    <p>2. User tasks: They were asked to perform two tasks, "watch a specific course video" and
                        "confirm completion of a learning task for today".</p>
                    <p>3. Feedback: Users were then asked to indicate their three favorite and least favorite
                        feelings.</p>
